# Image Annotator
**Problem Statement or Motivation.**

1. Many ML models need a labeled dataset from which the model can learn to make correct predictions. For this human labelers need to label all the required segments of the images correctly.
2. The ML models then use these labels to learn features during training.
Once trained, the models are then used to classify new data.
3. Having an accurately labelled data is essential as the model accuracy
depends on it.
4. So we need a tool which makes this image labeling process convenient and accurate.

Image Labelling and Exporting Annotation files.

1. Users can upload image files or folder using "Upload files/folder" menu.
2. Uploaded image thumbnails are shown on the left side bar as preview.
3. Users can click on any thumbnail to start labelling the image.
4. Bounding boxes can be drawn and saved using mouse click, drag, release and enter.
5. All the saved labels are displayed on the right side bar, which can be verified by clicking on it.
6. Users can label multiple segments of an image and also delete any unwanted labels.
7. All the saved annotations can be exported either in json or csv format using "Export Labels" menu.

Importing Annotation files and verification.

1. Annotation files(.csv or .json format) can be uploaded using the ”Import Labels” option under "Upload files/folder" menu, along with corresponding images.
2. Once an image is selected, click on the "Import Labels" button in the toolbar.
3. All the labels and the bouding boxes corresponding to the image are displayed.
